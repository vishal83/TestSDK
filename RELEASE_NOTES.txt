Known Issues
------------

This list covers some of the known problems with Revive Adserver. Please read
this before reporting any new bugs.

 * The upgrade process may time out with very large databases. See
   http://www.revive-adserver.com/docs/faq for more information if you
   have a large database.

 * Revive Adserver requires PHP 5. If you are using PHP 4, you will need to
   update your web server to use PHP 5 before upgrading.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with MySQL, please note that MySQL 4.1 or
   higher is required. If you are using an older version of MySQL, you will
   need to update you database software before upgrading.

 * If you want to run Revive Adserver with PostgreSQL, please note that
   PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher is required. If you are using an older version of
   PostgreSQL, you will need to update your database software before
   upgrading.

 * Some of the PEAR libraries used are not compatible with database prefix
   names with double "_" characters (e.g. "rv__"). You should NOT install
   Revive Adserver with a prefix of this format.

 * Some users have reported issues of being logged out when viewing
   statistics. This can be worked around by ensuring that the timezone is
   correctly set in PHP.
